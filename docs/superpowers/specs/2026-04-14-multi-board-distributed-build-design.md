# Multi-board distributed build (V2 testbed → V3 enabler)

## Goal

Split the running system across two Nerves devices connected by a wired LAN,
communicating via distributed Erlang and Phoenix.PubSub, so that:

1. The reTerminal DM (CM4) runs the trainer, touch input, web UI, and digital
   twin.
2. A second headless Raspberry Pi 4B drives all the physical TLC5947 LED
   chains via its own SPI buses.

The immediate target is a V2-equivalent build (4→3→3 pattern classifier) running
in this split topology, primarily as a testbed. Once proven, the same
architecture unlocks V3 (5×5 MNIST), which cannot fit its required SPI bus
count on a single board.

## Non-goals

- Changing the Trainer or Chain logic itself.
- Changing the V2 wiring layout.
- A multi-trainer or HA design --- if the trainer node is down, the
  installation is down.
- Supporting more than two nodes.

## Why this is feasible with small surface area

The current code is already cleanly decomposed along the right seam:

- `NeonPerceptron.Trainer` continuously trains and broadcasts a `NetworkState`
  on Phoenix.PubSub topic `"network_state"` every 33ms
  (`lib/neon_perceptron/trainer.ex`).
- `NeonPerceptron.Chain` GenServers subscribe to that topic
  (`lib/neon_perceptron/chain.ex:67`), render the slice of the network they
  represent, and push to SPI.
- `Phoenix.PubSub`'s default PG adapter broadcasts to all connected Erlang
  nodes transparently. Once two Nerves nodes are clustered, a `Chain` running
  on either node receives the same broadcasts with no code change.
- `application.ex` already reads a `:role` env (defaulting to `:trainer`) and
  has a `build_children/2` that branches on it, so the supervision split has a
  hook in place.

Therefore the change is *supervision gating + node clustering*, not a refactor
of the network or rendering code.

```

- Wired Ethernet only. WiFi is explicitly excluded for this installation.
- The switch's WAN uplink lets both boards reach the internet for OTA updates
  via `mix upload`, but the two Nerves nodes communicate over the local LAN
  segment.
- Both nodes get DHCP from the venue router and advertise via mDNS using the
  existing `mdns_lite` configuration in `config/target.exs`.

## V2 wiring (unchanged from current `chain_configs/0`)

Both chains live on the LED node. The wiring is identical to today's
`Builds.V2.chain_configs/0`:

| spidev    | Chain ID      | Chips | Contents                                     |
|-----------|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| spidev1.0 | `:input_left` | 2     | input[0], input[2]                           |
| spidev0.0 | `:main`       | 11    | input[1], input[3], hidden×6 (front+rear), output×3 |

No change to `lib/neon_perceptron/builds/v2.ex` is required for the wiring
itself --- only the host board changes. The build module still defines the
chains; the LED node starts them; the trainer node skips them.

## Software architecture

### Roles

Extend the existing `:role` Application env to three explicit values. Default
remains `:standalone` so all dev/host workflows and the existing single-board
setup continue to work unchanged.

| Role           | Trainer | Chains | Phoenix Endpoint | Touch | mix target use            |
|----------------|---------|--------|------------------|-------|---------------------------|
| `:standalone`  | yes     | yes    | yes              | yes   | host, single-board firmware |
| `:trainer`     | yes     | no     | yes              | yes   | UI node firmware (reTerminal DM) |
| `:led_driver`  | no      | yes    | no               | no    | LED node firmware (RPi 4B)       |

`:standalone` is the default, ensuring backwards compatibility with V1 and the
existing single-board V2.

### Supervision changes (`lib/neon_perceptron/application.ex`)

`build_children/2` is the only function that needs to change:

- `:trainer` role: start `Trainer` and `extra_children`, but skip `Chain`
  workers.
- `:led_driver` role: start `Chain` workers and `PubSub`, but skip `Trainer`,
  `Touch`, and the `Endpoint`.
- `:standalone`: current behaviour.

The current `phoenix_children/0` helper bundles `Phoenix.PubSub` with
`Endpoint`. Split this: `pubsub_children/0` (always started, on every role)
and `endpoint_children/0` (only `:standalone` and `:trainer`). PubSub is the
distribution mechanism --- both nodes must run it.

### Clustering

Add `libcluster` as a dependency. Configure two strategies:

- **`Cluster.Strategy.Epmd`** with a static node list for production firmware:
  `[:"neon_perceptron@nerves-ui.local", :"neon_perceptron@nerves-leds.local"]`.
  Static lists are simpler, more predictable, and require no service discovery.
- The `:standalone` role does not start libcluster (no peer to connect to).

The Erlang cookie is baked into firmware at build time. Both firmware images
must be built with the same cookie. A small `config/cookie.exs` (gitignored,
generated locally) feeds `:vm_args` for both targets.

Node names: `neon_perceptron@nerves-ui.local` and
`neon_perceptron@nerves-leds.local`. Configured via `vm.args.eex` in
`rel/`.

### Distributed PubSub

No code change. `Phoenix.PubSub` started under `phoenix_children/0` (renamed
to acknowledge that PubSub is needed in non-Phoenix roles too) uses the
default PG adapter, which broadcasts to all subscribers across all connected
nodes.

When the LED node connects, its `Chain` subscribers automatically receive
broadcasts from the trainer's `Trainer` process on the UI node.

### Bench test mode (TestPattern build, LED node standalone)

The existing `Builds.TestPattern` module is already a self-contained bench test
for SPI wiring: it has no `trainer_config` (returns `nil`), declares chains
that mirror V2's wiring exactly, and uses a local `Ticker` GenServer (started
via `extra_children/0`) that pushes frames to chains directly via
`Chain.update/2`, bypassing PubSub.

This composes cleanly with the role architecture. A second firmware variant
for the LED board can be built with `build: Builds.TestPattern, role:
:led_driver`: the LED board then boots, starts its chains + the local Ticker,
and drives test patterns without needing the trainer node or any
clustering. Ideal for powering up the LED board alone on the bench and
verifying every chip lights up.

Two LED-board firmware variants, selectable at build time:

| Variant          | Build              | Role           | Purpose                                |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| LED production   | `Builds.V2`        | `:led_driver`  | Clustered; receives from trainer node. |
| LED bench test   | `Builds.TestPattern` | `:led_driver` | Standalone; local Ticker drives chains.|

Switching between them is a firmware reflash (`mix upload nerves-leds.local`),
not a runtime toggle. For installation use we always run LED production; for
bench or debug use we flash LED bench test.

Implementation note: `application.ex` `build_children/2` must still call
`extra_children/0` on the `:led_driver` role (TestPattern's Ticker lives
there). On the `:trainer` role, `extra_children/0` should be skipped for
builds like TestPattern whose extras depend on local chains --- or TestPattern
simply isn't a valid build for the trainer node. We document it as
LED-node-only.

### Trainer-offline fallback (deferred)

If the trainer node disappears during production, `Chain` processes stop
receiving messages and hold their last frame indefinitely. For a public
installation this may be undesirable.

A future enhancement unifies this with the bench-test mechanism: each `Chain`
tracks the timestamp of the last received frame. If no frame for N seconds
(configurable, default 5s), the LED node falls back to rendering
TestPattern-style frames locally, signalling "system alive, no trainer". When
the trainer returns, the next broadcast pre-empts the fallback.

This is **out of scope for the initial split**. We add it once the split
itself is proven.

## Firmware & deployment

Three firmware artifacts from one repo (two production, one bench):

| Firmware       | MIX_TARGET | Nerves system      | Build               | Role          | Host name           |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| UI             | rpi4      | reterminal_dm      | `Builds.V2`         | `:trainer`    | `nerves-ui.local`   |
| LED production | rpi4      | nerves_system_rpi4 | `Builds.V2`         | `:led_driver` | `nerves-leds.local` |
| LED bench      | rpi4      | nerves_system_rpi4 | `Builds.TestPattern` | `:led_driver` | `nerves-leds.local` |

Build commands (suggested mix aliases or scripts):

```sh
# UI firmware (reTerminal DM)
NERVES_HOSTNAME=nerves-ui NERVES_ROLE=trainer \
  mise exec -- env MIX_TARGET=rpi4 MIX_ENV=prod mix firmware

# LED firmware (Pi 4B)
NERVES_HOSTNAME=nerves-leds NERVES_ROLE=led_driver \
  mise exec -- env MIX_TARGET=rpi4 MIX_ENV=prod mix firmware
```

`mix.exs` selects the Nerves system based on an env var (e.g.
`NERVES_TARGET_VARIANT=ui|led`), since both firmwares use `MIX_TARGET=rpi4`
but different system deps.

OTA updates work as today: `mix upload nerves-ui.local` and
`mix upload nerves-leds.local`. The shared switch's WAN uplink ensures both
hosts are reachable from a developer laptop on the same network.

## Failure modes

| Scenario                                | Behaviour                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boot ordering (either node first)        | Subscriber connects on join; receives next 33ms broadcast.                                 |
| LED node reboots / cable pulled          | UI + digital twin keep running. LEDs freeze on last frame, resume on reconnect.            |
| Trainer node reboots                     | LEDs hold last frame until trainer restarts (or until watchdog triggers, once added).      |
| Switch / router reboot                   | Both nodes briefly disconnected. `libcluster` reconnects automatically.                    |
| Latency budget                           | Distributed Erlang over wired LAN is ~0.5--3ms; rare spikes ~10ms. 30Hz frame budget is 33ms. |
| Erlang cookie mismatch                   | Nodes refuse to connect. Visible in logs. Caught at first integration test.                |
| Venue network down (no WAN)              | Local cluster still works. Only OTA blocked.                                               |

## Validation plan (V2 testbed)

1. Build both firmwares with V2 build module.
2. Bench setup: reTerminal DM + spare Pi 4B + small switch.
3. Verify nodes auto-cluster (check `Node.list/0` from IEx on both).
4. Verify all 13 boards light up correctly when touch input changes.
5. Soak test: run for 4+ hours at 30Hz, check for:
   - Chain GenServer crashes
   - Mailbox backlog on either side
   - libcluster reconnect events in logs
   - Any visible LED glitching / latency
6. Failure injection:
   - Pull and reconnect the LED node's ethernet cable. LEDs should resume
     within a few seconds of reconnection.
   - Reboot the LED node. Should rejoin and resume.
   - Reboot the UI node. LED node should hold last frame until it returns.

If the testbed survives, V3 is de-risked: same architecture, same
communication path, just more chains on the LED side.

## Open questions

- **Specific libcluster strategy**: static `Epmd` strategy with hardcoded
  hostnames is the proposed default. mDNS-based discovery (e.g.
  `Cluster.Strategy.Mdns` from a community lib) is an alternative that avoids
  the static list, at the cost of an extra dependency. Recommend starting
  with `Epmd` static.
- **Cookie management**: where the cookie file lives (gitignored local,
  injected by env, etc). Suggest a single `config/cookie.exs` loaded only when
  building firmware, with a `.example` file checked in.
- **PubSub topic isolation**: currently `"network_state"` is the only topic.
  As the system grows we may want a `"control"` topic for trainer commands
  (reset, mode change) initiated from the UI side. Out of scope for now.

## Out of scope (for this design)

- LED-side watchdog / fallback render (deferred).
- Touch input forwarding from LED node (LED node has no input).
- Multi-trainer / HA / failover.
- Encrypted distribution channel (TLS for Erlang dist). Closed installation
  network is the trust boundary.
- V3 wiring (separate spec, but uses this architecture).
