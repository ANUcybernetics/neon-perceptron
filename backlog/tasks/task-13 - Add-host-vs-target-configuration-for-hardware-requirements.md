## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create separate configuration profiles for host development (config/host.exs) and target deployment (config/target.exs) to explicitly configure whether hardware peripherals are required or optional. This allows developers to understand the expected runtime environment and makes hardware availability expectations explicit.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 config/host.exs exists with hardware_required: false settings
- [ ] #2 config/target.exs exists with hardware_required: true settings
- [ ] #3 Hardware modules read configuration to determine behavior
- [ ] #4 Documentation explains the difference between host and target modes
- [ ] #5 Mix environment properly loads correct config based on MIX_TARGET or similar
- [ ] #6 Tests verify configuration is loaded correctly in both environments
